# Optimised Minecraft Server Configs

Configuration files, optimised and tested. 

## Installation

10-25 players - [Paper](https://papermc.io/)
30-50 players - [Tuinity](https://ci.codemc.io/job/Spottedleaf/job/Tuinity/)
50 - 100 players - [PurPur](https://purpur.pl3x.net/downloads/) or [PurPlane](https://github.com/notOM3GA/Purplane) (This is not supported by the devs/purpur, but i'm happy to support you if you need it, no issues have really been found with this jar though.)
100+ - [Airplane](https://airplane.gg/) - Not tested by me, but I have heard about amazing performance boost at high playercounts.

## What configs to use
If your jar is:
Paper: `bukkit.yml` `paper.yml` `server.properties` `spigot.yml`
Tuinity: `bukkit.yml` `paper.yml` `server.properties` `spigot.yml` `tuinity.yml`
PurPur: `bukkit.yml` `paper.yml` `server.properties` `spigot.yml` `purpur.yml`
Airplane: `bukkit.yml` `paper.yml` `server.properties` `spigot.yml` `tuinity.yml`
